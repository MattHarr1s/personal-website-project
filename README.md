##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent job on Milestone 1. This is a great idea, and I'm looking forward to seeing this take shape. This project has plenty of room to scale up going forward, especially with the inclusion of blogging functionality. Due to the limited scope of the PWP, we aren't able to include blogging functionality at this time.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Great job.

###To Do
One pesky thing... in your .gitignore, on line 1, there should be a capital S in "Store". That's all. Overall, your code is great!

##Milestone 2 Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone 2. Andrea sure sounds like a lady in need of a little romance. Everything here is excellent, and you have a clear direction laid for your PWP. 

Does your wife currently have a mailing list set up, or do we need to set one up for her?

Great job, your Milestone 2 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

## Milestone 4 Feedback
Hi Matt, thanks for submitting Milestone 4 on time. You have a lot of work ahead here. I suggest keeping things very simple and straightforward. Take a look at the examples I have up on bootcamp-coders, and [Sending Email with PHP](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/php/email/) for instructions on swiftmailer. Consider creating a single page at this time. I'm concerned you don't have enough time to complete a full site.

### Suggestions
- Create an index.php page inside /public_html. Begin your development there. You can delete the /documentation directory after class.
- When you deploy to A Small Orange (when your site is 80% complete), go to CPanel to set the Document Root to your /public_html directory.
