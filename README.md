##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent job on Milestone 1. This is a great idea, and I'm looking forward to seeing this take shape. This project has plenty of room to scale up going forward, especially with the inclusion of blogging functionality. Due to the limited scope of the PWP, we aren't able to include blogging functionality at this time.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Great job.

###To Do
One pesky thing... in your .gitignore, on line 1, there should be a capital S in "Store". That's all. Overall, your code is great!

##Milestone 2 Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone 2. Andrea sure sounds like a lady in need of a little romance. Everything here is excellent, and you have a clear direction laid for your PWP. 

Does your wife currently have a mailing list set up, or do we need to set one up for her?

Great job, your Milestone 2 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

## Milestone 3 Feedback
Great job here Matt. Go ahead and get started on development. This layout will be a breeze using Bootstrap. Your Milestone 3 passes at Tier IV.
