##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent job on Milestone 1. This is a great idea, and I'm looking forward to seeing this take shape. This project has plenty of room to scale up going forward, especially with the inclusion of blogging functionality. Due to the limited scope of the PWP, we aren't able to include blogging functionality at this time.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Great job.

###To Do
One pesky thing... in your .gitignore, on line 1, there should be a capital S in "Store". That's all. Overall, your code is great!
