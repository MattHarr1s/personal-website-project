				<p>Juliana Conners writes romances you can get lost in, about addictive bad boys and the luscious, curvy
					ladies who win their hearts. She's a part-time lawyer and full-time mom, who prefers to write whenever
					possible!
				</p>

				<p>
					Juliana aims to live by the Omar Khayyam motto: "Be happy for this moment, for this moment is your life."
					In addition to writing, she enjoys reading, traveling, skiing and listening to music... preferably all
					while in the company of her husband and their young son.
