		<h1>Outline of "Author Page" Personal Website Project</h1>
		<!-Paragraph explaining the purpose of the author page website concept->
		<p>For my personal website project I will create a website for an e-book author to showcase their works. This site
			will help my wife promote the novel she is currently preparing for self-publication in e-book format, and will
			help me secure freelance work creating author pages for the many self-published authors currently using inferior
			 (or none at all) websites to promote their work.
