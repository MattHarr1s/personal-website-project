		<h1>Outline of "Author Page" Personal Website Project</h1>
		<!-Paragraph explaining the purpose of the author page website concept->
		<p>For my personal website project I will create a website for an e-book author to showcase their works. This site
			will help my wife promote the novel she is currently preparing for self-publication in e-book format, and will
			help me secure freelance work creating author pages for the many self-published authors currently using inferior
			websites to promote their work.
		</p>
		<!-Potential features of "Author Page" project>
		<h2>Features of "Author Page"</h2>
		<p>As an exercise in front-end development, this site will contain a main page featuring the author's name and
		most current and popular works, along with individual pages for each work containing convenient
		links to view the works in 3rd party e-commerce sites(amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com, ect..),
		provide a mailing list sign-up for fans, a blog, and pages for any other information an
		author might wish to convey to the public.
		</p>
