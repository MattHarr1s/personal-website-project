		<h1>Outline of "Author Page" Personal Website Project</h1>
		<!-Paragraph explaining the purpose of the author page website concept->
		<p>For my personal website project I will create a website for an e-book author to showcase their works. This site
			will help my wife promote the novel she is currently preparing for self-publication in e-book format, and will
			help me secure freelance work creating author pages for the many self-published authors currently using inferior
			 (or none at all) websites to promote their work.
		</p>
		<!-Potential features of "Author Page" project>
		<h2>Features of "Author Page"</h2>
		<p>As an exercise in front-end development, this site will contain features common to an author page including:</p>
			<!-List of features->
			<ul>
				<li>Main page including the author's name, most popular works and newest releases.</li>
				<li>Pages for each of the author's titles, with links to view the works in 3rd party e-commerce sites
				(amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com, ect..)</li>
				<li>Mailing list sign-up</li>
				<li>Blog</li>
				<li>Any other features agreed upon by the developer and client</li>
			</ul>
