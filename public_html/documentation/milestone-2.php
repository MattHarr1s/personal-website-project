		<h1>Andrea Baldwin</h1>
		<!-Paragraph explaining Andrea Baldwin's persona->
		<p>Andrea Baldwin is a 42 year old married secretary. After 3 children and the 50lbs that brings, her 20 year
			marriage doesn't give her the excitement and romance of her youth. Instead Andrea's life has become rather
			routine; work, pick the kids up from soccer practice, have dinner with the family,
			do the laundry, and finally, watch tv with her husband. Luckily, Andrea never thinks about running away from
			her family and finally living her teenage dream of leaving Kentucky.As long as Andrea has her Kindle Paperwhite,
			she can experience the thrill of being swept off her feet by a billionaire in a whirl-wind romance, or the danger
			of dating an ex-military bad boy who is always breaking the rules. Now boring tasks like waiting for her child
			to finish soccer practice, or watching tv with her husband, Andrea is able to pull out her Kindle Paperwhite
			and discretely escape with the current man of her fantasies. Andrea is constantly looking for new romance novels to
			satisfy her need for romance and adventure, however most of the author sites are nearly not safe for work.
			Because of this, if Andrea new releases by her favorite authors while at the office she
			uses her iPhone5s and its 4G LTE to view the websites of the authors. While at home Andrea uses her iPad Air to
			do general web surfing, read the news, send emails, and use social media sites, primarily Facebook. She also has
			her trusty Kindle Paperwhite and a 2012 Acer Netbook which she rarely uses.</p>
