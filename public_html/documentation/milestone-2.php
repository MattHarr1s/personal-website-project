		<h1>Andrea Baldwin</h1>
		<!-Paragraph explaining Andrea Baldwin's persona and use case scenarios->
		<p>Andrea Baldwin is a 42 year old married secretary. After 3 children and 20 years of marriage,
			Andrea's life has become rather routine; work, pick the kids up from soccer practice, have dinner with the family,
			do the laundry, and finally, watch tv with her husband. Andrea never thinks about running away from from her boring life
			in Kentucky thanks to her Kindle Paperwhite, and the numerous forbidden romances and steamy adventures of the
			Kindle Store.
			instead preferring to get comfortable in the shallow end before wading deeper into life experiences.
			When a new novelty grabs the reigns of Shawn's attention it doesn't let go until Shawn has tried the
			new activity. Whether it's gardening or skiing, Shawn won't lift a single shovel or pole until he
			completes several hours of internet research from his two primary devices:
		</p>
		<!-List of Shawn's Devices>
		<ol>
			<!-iPhone 5s Primary device for researching new interests->
			<li>iPhone 5s 16 GB</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Screen size: 4 inch screen</li>
				<li>Screen resolution: 1136 x 640</li>
				<li>Storage capacity: 16 GB</li>
				<li>GSM Radio: 4G LTE</li>
				<li>Carrier: AT&T</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>Shawn is rarely found without his trusty iPhone 5s. The 4 inch screen is the perfect balance between
				viewability and functionality and Shawn does everything from it. Siri and Shawn are on a first name
				basis with Siri often giving Shawn recommendations for restaurants, movies and other activities.
				When Shawn needs to know something right away his iPhone has the reliability he requires to always
				have information at glance, without unexpected hiccups keeping him from the knowledge he craves.</p>
			<!-Macbook Air Secondary Device used for web surfing, social media, banking, travel, shopping as well
			as document creation and book keeping->
			<li>Macbook Air 13.3"</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Intel Core i5 1.6GHz</li>
				<li>13.3" 1440 &times; 900 LED Backlit Display</li>
				<li>128GB SSD Flash Storage</li>
				<li>Mac OS X Yosemite</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>When his iPhone just isn't powerful enough for the task, Shawn opens up his Macbook and performs
				serious work on the 13'3 inch HD display. The core i5 1.6ghz processor is plenty powerful for the
				times Shawn needs to edit photos, update his financial spreadsheets, or create a sample portfolio for a
				potential client. Shawn also enjoys surfing the web and learning about new hobbies from the beautiful
				1440 &times; 900 LED back-lit display.
