		<h1>Andrea Baldwin</h1>
		<!-Paragraph explaining Andrea Baldwin's persona->
		<p>Andrea Baldwin is a 42 year old married secretary. After 3 children and the 50lbs that brings, her 20 year
			marriage doesn't give her the excitement and romance of her youth. Instead Andrea's life has become rather
			routine; work, pick the kids up from soccer practice, have dinner with the family,
			do the laundry, and finally, watch tv with her husband. Luckily, Andrea never thinks about running away from
			her family and finally living her teenage dream of leaving Kentucky.As long as Andrea has her Kindle Paperwhite,
			she can experience the thrill of being swept off her feet by a billionaire in a whirl-wind romance, or the danger
			of dating an ex-military bad boy who is always breaking the rules. Now boring tasks like waiting for her child
			to finish soccer practice, or watching tv with her husband, Andrea is able to pull out her Kindle Paperwhite
			and discretely escape with the current man of her fantasies. Andrea is constantly looking for new romance novels to
			satisfy her need for romance and adventure, however most of the author sites are nearly not safe for work.
			Because of this, if Andrea new releases by her favorite authors while at the office she
			uses her iPhone5s and its 4G LTE to view the websites of the authors. While at home Andrea uses her iPad Air to
			do general web surfing, read the news, send emails, and use social media sites, primarily Facebook. She also has
			her trusty Kindle Paperwhite and a 2012 Acer Netbook which she rarely uses.</p>
		<br>

		<p><h4>Goals:</h4>As a working mother, Andrea lives a busy life which leaves her little time to both read and stay up
		to date with the authors she is reading. When Andrea starts reading a book by a new author, she wants to quickly find out
		the size of this author's catalog and the types of works it contains, while taking a break at the office or waiting
		for dinner to come out of the oven. She usually has about five minutes to get her phone out and find an author's catalog.

		<h2>Use Case</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Andrea Baldwin recently started reading an enthralling book by an author she has never heard of. She found the book
		through a promotion on the Kindle Store and has spent all of her free time reading. She has almost finished the book
		and is craving the type of adventure this author delivers. </p><p>It is 5:25pm on Wednesday
		afternoon and Andrea is sitting in her Toyota Sienna in the parking lot of the local soccer complex,
		waiting for her daughter to get in the van. Her daughter usually is in the van around 5:30 so Andrea doesn't have
		enough time to finish the book and instead opts to save it for later tonight. Knowing that she will finish the book
		before the end of the day makes Andrea sad. While waiting for her daughter, she decides to look up the author of the book
		on her iPhone's Safari browser. After finding the author's page through a Google search, Andrea's interactions
			with the site are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lands on mobile responsive home page.</li>
				<li>Clicks hamburger button in upper right corner, opening the navigation menu.</li>
				<li>Clicks the catalog link and views the titles, tag lines, and covers of two books.</li>
				<li>After delightfully viewing the two book titles, Andrea navigates to the "About Me" page of the Author.
					Where she spends about one minute reading the author's bio. Andrea bookmarks the page and plans on viewing
					it on her iPad later that evening</li>
			</ul>
